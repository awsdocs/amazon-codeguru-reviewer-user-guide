If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next section, [Configure IAM permissions](get-set-up-configure-iam-permissions.md)\. 

If you don't have an AWS account, you can use the following procedure to create one\. If you are a new Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer customer, you can sign up for a 90\-day free trial\. 

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root)\.
