# Data protection for CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="data-protection"></a>

The AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) applies to data protection in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer\. As described in this model, AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud\. You are responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure\. This content includes the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services that you use\. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq)\. For information about data protection in Europe, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model and GDPR](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/) blog post on the *AWS Security Blog*\.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. That way each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties\. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:
+ Use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) with each account\.
+ Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\.
+ Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail\.
+ Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services\.
+ Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3\.
+ If you require FIPS 140\-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint\. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS\) 140\-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/)\.

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your customers' email addresses, into tags or free\-form fields such as a **Name** field\. This includes when you work with CodeGuru Reviewer or other AWS services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs\. Any data that you enter into tags or free\-form fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs\. If you provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials information in the URL to validate your request to that server\.

## Captured data in CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="data-captured"></a>

 CodeGuru Reviewer stores the following to create code reviews: 
+  Repository metadata, such as the name and owner of a repository 
+  Recommendations generated by CodeGuru Reviewer
+  Pull request metadata, such as the author and branch of a pull request 
+  Feedback submitted by customers about code reviews 
+ The OAuth token for each GitHub associated repository\. This does not apply to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud associated repositories\.
+ Source code is transiently stored in memory until its code review is complete\. This typically lasts a few hours\. When the code review is complete, it is flushed from memory, encrypted and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for up to 10 days, and then deleted\.

## Data retention in CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="data-retention"></a>

Stored associated repository metadata \(for example, the name and owner of the repository\) and, for GitHub associated repositories, an OAuth token, are stored until the associated repository is disassociated\. After an associated repository is disassociated, you can no longer see its recommendations\. Recommendations and pull request metadata \(for example, the branch name\) are retained for one year, and then deleted\. Feedback provided to help CodeGuru Reviewer improve future recommendations is retained forever\. 

## Data encryption in CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="data-encryption"></a>

Encryption is an important part of CodeGuru Reviewer security\. Data in transit and at rest are encrypted by default and don't require you to do anything\. 
+ **Encryption of data at rest** – Data collected by CodeGuru Reviewer is stored using Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon DynamoDB\. The data is encrypted using their data\-at\-rest encryption capabilities\. 
+ **Encryption of data in transit** – All communication between customers and CodeGuru Reviewer and between CodeGuru Reviewer and its downstream dependencies is protected using TLS connections that are signed using the Signature Version 4 signing process\. All CodeGuru Reviewer endpoints use SHA\-256 certificates that are managed by AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority\. For more information, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) and [What is ACM PCA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/)\. 
+ **Associated repository and code review encryption** – Associated repositories and code reviews are encrypted by default using a key that AWS owns and manages\. If you do not want to use a key managed by AWS, you must create an AWS Key Management Service key\. For more information, see [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) and [AWS Key Management Service concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service User Guide* and [Encrypting a repository association in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](encrypt-repository-association.md)\. 

## Traffic privacy<a name="security-traffic-privacy"></a>

You can improve the security of associated repositories and code reviews by configuring CodeGuru Reviewer to use an interface VPC endpoint\. To do this, you do not need an internet gateway, NAT device, or virtual private gateway\. It also is not required to configure AWS PrivateLink, though it is recommended\. For more information, see [CodeGuru Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)](vpc-interface-endpoints.md)\. For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Accessing AWS services through PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Introduction.html#what-is-privatelink)\.
