# Setting up Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="setting-up-codeguru-reviewer"></a>

Complete the tasks in this section to set up Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer for the first time\. If you already have an AWS account, know the repository that contains the source code you want reviewed, and prefer to use the defaults for IAM, skip ahead to [Getting started](getting-started-with-guru.md)\.

You should know the following about Amazon Web Services \(AWS\): 
+ When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account automatically has access to all services in AWS, including CodeGuru Reviewer\. However, you are charged only for the services that you use\. 
+ With CodeGuru Reviewer, you pay for the size of each of your associated repositories measured in lines of code\. For more information, see [Amazon CodeGuru pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/pricing/)\.
**Note**  
You can suppress recommendations from CodeGuru Reviewer, which reduces the number of lines of code analyzed and, by extension, might reduce costs\. For more information, see [Suppress recommendations](recommendation-suppression.md)\.
