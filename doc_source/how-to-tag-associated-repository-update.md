# Add or update tags for a CodeGuru Reviewer associated repository<a name="how-to-tag-associated-repository-update"></a>

You can change the value for a tag associated with an associated repository or add a new tag\. Keep in mind that there are limits on the characters you can use in the key and value fields\. For more information, see [Limits](quotas.md#limits-tags)\.

**Important**  
Updating the value of a tag for an associated repository can impact access to that associated repository\. Before you update the value of a tag for an associated repository, make sure to review any IAM policies that might use the value to control access to resources such as associated repositories\. For examples of tag\-based access policies, see [Using tags to control access to Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer associated repositories](auth-and-access-control-using-tags.md)\.
