# Authenticating with identities in CodeGuru Reviewer<a name="security_iam_authentication"></a>

Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials\. For more information about signing in using the AWS Management Console, see [Signing in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

You must be *authenticated* \(signed in to AWS\) as the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role\. You can also use your company's single sign\-on authentication or even sign in using Google or Facebook\. In these cases, your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles\. When you access AWS using credentials from another company, you are assuming a role indirectly\. 

To sign in directly to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), use your password with your root user email address or your IAM user name\. You can access AWS programmatically using your root user or IAM users access keys\. AWS provides SDK and command line tools to cryptographically sign your request using your credentials\. If you don't use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself\. Do this using *Signature Version 4*, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests\. For more information about authenticating requests, see [Signature Version 4 signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might also be required to provide additional security information\. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) to increase the security of your account\. To learn more, see [Using multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## AWS account root user<a name="security_iam_authentication-rootuser"></a>

  When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) in the *AWS General Reference*\. 

## IAM users and groups<a name="security_iam_authentication-iamuser"></a>

An *[IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)* is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application\. An IAM user can have long\-term credentials such as a user name and password or a set of access keys\. To learn how to generate access keys, see [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. When you generate access keys for an IAM user, make sure you view and securely save the key pair\. You cannot recover the secret access key in the future\. Instead, you must generate a new access key pair\.

An [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html) is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users\. You can't sign in as a group\. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time\. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users\. For example, you could have a group named *IAMAdmins* and give that group permissions to administer IAM resources\.

Users are different from roles\. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it\. Users have permanent long\-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials\. To learn more, see [When to create an IAM user \(instead of a role\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## IAM roles<a name="security_iam_authentication-iamrole"></a>

An *[IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)* is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions\. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person\. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in the AWS Management Console by [switching roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html)\. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL\. For more information about methods for using roles, see [Using IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:
+ **Temporary IAM user permissions** – An IAM user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task\. 
+ **Federated user access** –  Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, or the IAM Identity Center identity store\. These identities are known as *federated identities*\. To assign permissions to federated identities, you can create a role and define permissions for the role\. When an external identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by it\. If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set\. IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM to control what your identities can access after they authenticate\. For more information about identity federation, see [ Creating a role for a third\-party Identity Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For more information about IAM Identity Center, see [ What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\. 
+ **Cross\-account access** – You can use an IAM role to allow someone \(a trusted principal\) in a different account to access resources in your account\. Roles are the primary way to grant cross\-account access\. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource \(instead of using a role as a proxy\)\. To learn the difference between roles and resource\-based policies for cross\-account access, see [How IAM roles differ from resource\-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Cross\-service access** –  Some AWS services use features in other AWS services\. For example, when you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3\. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service\-linked role\. 
  + **Principal permissions** –  When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal\. Policies grant permissions to a principal\. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different service\. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions\. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awskeymanagementservice.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference*\. 
  + **Service role** –  A service role is an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf\. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM\. For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 
  + **Service\-linked role** –  A service\-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service\. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf\. Service\-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service\. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service\-linked roles\. 
+ **Applications running on Amazon EC2** –  You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests\. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance\. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance\. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
